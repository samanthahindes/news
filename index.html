        <p>Any TV lover wants to know which of their favorite shows will be picked up for the next season and if any will be taken off the air. Television networks are already making major decisions about the shows that will not be picked up for the upcoming Summer and Fall season. So far, long standing shows, such as Once Upon a Time, Scandal, and Grey's Anatomy, have all been picked up for another season. The Bachelor has been picked up for a 21st season, while Law & Order: SVU has been given an 18th season. HBO's Girls (see picture) has been picked up for a 7th and final season.
